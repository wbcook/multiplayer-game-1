# game-framework
This is a generic multiplayer game framework used by me. The master branch
contains a minimal implementation of multiplayer interaction on top of which
more functionality can be added. Read about it How To Build A Multiplayer Game
[part one](https://medium.com/@omgimanerd/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-browser-game-4a793818c29b#.cgcrdee49) and [part two](https://medium.com/@omgimanerd/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-browser-game-part-2-2edd112aabdf#.nze6w0pgs).
